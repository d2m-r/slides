:::


## Communication: Email vs. Slack


### Email

- Private communication with professor/TAs
- Topics that concern *you and only you*
- Accommodation requests

### Slack

- Class-wide communication with instructors and students
- Topics that may concern others, e.g.:
    - Questions about course content
    - Clarifications about grading policies
    - Requests for support


::: notes

### Email

- Private communication with professors or TAs
- Use for personal matters, scheduling, or other private issues
    - Topics that concern you and only you
- Requests for accommodations

### Slack

- Class-wide communication with instructors and students
- Topics that may concern others, e.g.:
    - Questions about course content
    - Clarifications about course policies
    - Requests for troubleshooting and debugging support
    - Really anything that might help another student if they saw it!
- Optionally: Private communication with other students

:::

## Communication: Other

- Attend office hours to ask questions in person
    -   i.e. don't ask your "quick question" after class
- Notice for absences is not required
- Be cautious about disclosing personal information over email/Slack
- The [student toolkit]() has a guide to help write emails
    - Pro tip: Don't use chatGPT. It's super annoying.


::: notes
- Dr. Dowling's office hours are Thursdays 2-4pm by appointment
    - Appointments are required -- [book here]()
- *TA office hours information*
- Call me either Natalie or Dr/Professor Dowling
- You do not need to let us know if you will be missing class
    - But you can reach out if you feel behind due to absences
- Be cautious about disclosing personal information over email/Slack
    - Remember you *never* need to share details about your health!
- Stressed about emails? The [student toolkit]() has a guide to help you out
    -   Side note: We can tell when you use chatGPT. It really doesn't look good. We'd rather get a kind of weird email from you than one of those "I kindly request" emails.
- **Please do not line up to ask questions at the end of class.**
    - Those "1-minute" questions add up
    - That's what Slack is for
:::
    
## Climate

- View the class climate policy [here]().
- Basically, just be cool, ok?
- If you have problems with other students or the TA:
    - Contact me first
    - Escalate to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- If you have a problem with me:
    - Discuss it with me directly *if you feel comfortable doing so*
    - Bring it to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- **You can *always* go to CARES without going through me or anyone else first.**

::: notes
- View the class climate policy [here]().
- But really just...be cool, ok?
- We will all be kind, respectful, responsive, and supportive to one another in the classroom,
on Slack, and all other interaction.
- If you have problems with other students or the TA:
    - Contact me first (if possible)
    - If we can't resolve it contact [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- If you have a problem with me
    - Discuss it with me directly *if and only if you feel comfortable doing so*
        - I never want to be the cause of discomfort for anyone! If you have feedback that can help me be a better instructor, I want to hear it.
    - Bring it to [UChicago CARES](https://cares.uchicago.edu/)
- You can *always* go to CARES without going through anyone else first, but my goal is
to create a classroom climate where you feel comfortable talking to me about ways to create
a more welcoming and respectful environment.
:::

## Accessibility & Accommodation


- Requests for formal accommodations should go through Student Disability Services
    - *Graduate students* need to request accommodation letters be sent to me
    - You *never* need to disclose personal details to me or anyone outside SDS
- Meet with me in office hours for informal accommodation requests
    - Note: *All* arrangements must align with SDS policies for equity.
- You must schedule a meeting with me before Friday Week 2 to integrate accommodations into your accountability plan
    
::: notes
- Requests for formal accommodations should go through Student Disability Services
    - SDS will send *undergraduate* accommodation letters to me automatically
    - *Graduate students* need to ask SDS to send me a letter
    - You *never* need to disclose personal details to me or anyone outside SDS
- If you have an informal request for an accommodation, with me in office hours
    - We can almost always work something out, but we need to follow SDS policies
- After sending your letter, schedule a meeting with me to make an accommodation plan
    - If you do need accommodations, you will factor your accommodation plan into your 
    accountability plan (coming up in a couple slides)
:::

## Disclosing personal information

**You are never required to disclose personal information to me or any instructors.** These guidelines are for all classes at UChicago, not just this one.

You do *not* need to:

- Share details about your health, disability, or reasoning for accommodations
- Get a doctor's note for absences
    - *Your instructor is not allowed to ask for one!*
- Defend your need for accommodations

You are an adult with priorities and the capacity for cost/benefit decision-making. You can decide what you want to share and with whom. If you need to miss class because you have terrible period cramps, are having a panic attack, are recovering from a migraine, think your roommate might have COVID, need to cram for an exam for a different class, are shamefully hung over, or just really don't wanna come to campus. You do not need to explain yourself to me or anyone else. Just take care of yourself, and take responsibility for effects on your learning and grades.

This doesn't mean there are never consequences for missing class. You are responsible for keeping up with the material and assignments (per your accommodations, if applicable), and are subject to penalties defined by the syllabus.



## Accountability Plan

- **You create an assignment schedule for yourself.** 
    - Defining your own goals is part of the research workflow
    - This is part of *an explicit learning objective* and part of your grade
- You will create a personal timeline and accountability plan for the quarter
    - Checkpoints on Mondays of Weeks 3, 6, and 10 (see full syllabus)
- Optionally: Base your plan on the suggested timeline in the [assignment instructions]()
    - This is not supposed to feel overwhelming, so take advantage of this if it helps! 
- SDS approved accommodations for extensions are built into your plan
- **10%** of your final grade is based on your accountability plan, including:
    - Meeting the 3 checkpoint deadlines for the plan itself (meta-deadlines)
    - Meeting the deadlines you set for yourself
    - Reflecting on your progress and making adjustments
    - *Suggesting* a grade (of 10)

::: notes
- **You create an assignment schedule for yourself.** With very few exceptions, there are no top-down deadlines in this class. Why?
    - This class is about developing and maintaining a research workflow
    - A major part of that is learning how to set and meet your own deadlines
    - Making your own plan and sticking to it *is part of the syllabus*
- You will create a personal timeline and accountability plan for the quarter
    - Initial plans are due by Monday of Week 3
    - Revised plans and reflections are due by Monday of Week 6
    - Final reflections are due Monday of Week 10 (finals week)
- You can base your plan on the suggested timeline in the [assignment instructions]()
    - Use the suggested plan without changes (great option of the idea of designing your own schedule feels overwhelming)
    - Start with this plan and make adjustments
    - Start from scratch!
- If your SDS accommodations include extended deadlines, you will factor those into the plan
    - i.e. We are using this plan to agree on extensions now. I will not grant extensions to the
    planned extensions as we go.
- **10%** of your final grade is based on your accountability plan, including:
    - Meeting the actual deadlines that I have set for the plan itself
    - Meeting the deadlines you set for yourself
    - Reflecting on your progress and making adjustments to your plan
    - *Suggesting* a grade (of 10) for how well you think you followed your plan

## Academic Integrity: Overview

- View the academic integrity policy [here]().
- Plagiarism is bad. Cheating is bad. Don't do it.
    - Why are you even here?
- All written/textual content in your submitted assignments must be fully produced by you
- Code may be produced with AI (or human) assistance with a full disclosure statement
- Disclosure statements are required for *all submitted work*, even if you didn't use AI
    - Access the statement template with more detailed requirements [here]()

## Academic Integrity: Grading Penalties

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You will *not* be penalized for (with disclosure):

- Using AI to help you with *code*
- Using code snippets from print or online resources
- Co-writing *code* with classmates/other humans
- Unintentionally crossing the line with AI *if it is fully disclosed*
    - I will ask to you revise and resubmit without penalty

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

You *will* be penalized for:

- Failing to disclose any of the above
- Using AI to generate *text* for ANY submitted work
- Using *text* written by any human other than you, including classmates
    - Exceptions for some group projects may be granted, but must be requested in advance
:::
:::

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bolder;">Submissions that do not follow these guidelines will receive a non-negotiable 0.</span>

## Academic Integrity: You & AI

![The AIlephant in the room. This is DALL-E's best attempt at "An elephant with the letters A and I on its ears." Not very impressive, but I can't blame it too much. It wasn't a good pun to begin with.](../images/ai-lephant.png)

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

You should only be taking this class if you want to gain practical skills that will be useful to you outside of the class. 

Hopefully you are using the class to make progress on a research project you are invested in. If you do not use AI wisely, you may not be "cheating" in a way that will hurt your grade, but you will be cheating yourself out of the reason you joined the class. If you don't care enough to actually learn the material yourself, this probably isn't the right class for you.

You can read my [guide]() for what I personally believe are ethical and constructive uses of AI
in higher education.
