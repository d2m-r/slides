## Lecture planning

9. Basic visualization and summary statistics
    1. This chapter is not the ggplot2 chapter or a deep stats chapter. It's a connection
    between the two quarters of the class.
    2. Putting things together
        1. how data manipulation in the tidyverse leads to easier visualization
        2. how visualization leads to better understanding of your data
        3. how visualization and summary statistics fit together
    3. Distributions of continuous variables
        1. Histograms
        2. Box plots
        3. Summary statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation
    4. Comparing groups
        1. Bar plots
        2. Summary statistics: grouped means, medians, etc.
        3. t-tests
        4. More advanced for later: ANOVA, chi-squared tests
    5. Relationships between continuous variables
        1. Scatter plots and smoothing lines
        2. Correlation
        3. Basic linear regression
        4. More advanced for later: Multiple regression, logistic regression

## Housekeeping {.smaller}

This slide has smaller text

- Housekeeping
- and
- announcements
- without
- animation 

## Housekeeping {.bigger}

This slide has bigger text
 
- at least
- I hope so 

# New Main Section

## Simple Bulleted Slide

::: {.fragment .dimmable}
A top-level line that will be dimmed at first.
:::

With a [link](index.html).

### A Third Level Heading

::: {.incremental}
-   First level point
  -  Second level point
    -   Third level point
    -   Third level point 2
-   First level point 2

:::


## Code Slide

Introductory content:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
 
# Define class name
class_name <- "D2M-R"

# Print a message with the variable
paste("Hello", class_name)

```
 
**More information** about the code above.


## Bubbles from the bottom


::: bubble-chain
  <p class="bubble-left fragment">Students ask? Students ask?Students ask?Students ask?Students ask? Students ask? Students ask? Students ask? Students ask?Students ask? </p>
  <p class="bubble-right fragment">And I respond!</p>
:::

This slide has speech bubbles that pop in after all content has been covered.

The container is anchored at the bottom of the page, and the tails point downward.


- Left bubbles, in blue, are things I hear commonly from students
- Right bubbles, in red, are my responses




## Bubbles from the top
 
On this slide, things are a little different:

- The container is anchored to the top of the content section. 
- Bubbles are mirrored vertically with tails pointing up.

::: {.bubble-chain .top}
  <p class="bubble-left fragment">Students ask - UP TOP?</p>
  <p class="bubble-right fragment">And I respond, also up top!</p>
:::
 
 
## Callouts

::: {.callout}
Call-outs can be used without additional class features.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Tip: Use call-outs to highlight important information.
:::

::: {.callout-note}

## You can change the callout header from the default

Note: These are examples of call-outs.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Important: Don't forget to use call-outs!
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Warning: You have used too many callouts
:::


## Columns

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="20%"}
**tibble**  
reimagine the dataframe!
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
**readr**

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
**dplyr**

## Inline Styling

You can style things like:

- **bold text**
- *italic text*
- ~~strikethrough text~~
- [links]()
- `inline code`
- [function_names]{.func}
- [package_names]{.pkg}
