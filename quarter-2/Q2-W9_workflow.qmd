## Bubbles from the bottom


::: bubble-chain
  <p class="bubble-left fragment">Students ask? Students ask?Students ask?Students ask?Students ask? Students ask? Students ask? Students ask? Students ask?Students ask? </p>
  <p class="bubble-right fragment">And I respond!</p>
:::

This slide has speech bubbles that pop in after all content has been covered.

The container is anchored at the bottom of the page, and the tails point downward.


- Left bubbles, in blue, are things I hear commonly from students
- Right bubbles, in red, are my responses




## Bubbles from the top
 
On this slide, things are a little different:

- The container is anchored to the top of the content section. 
- Bubbles are mirrored vertically with tails pointing up.

::: {.bubble-chain .top}
  <p class="bubble-left fragment">Students ask - UP TOP?</p>
  <p class="bubble-right fragment">And I respond, also up top!</p>
